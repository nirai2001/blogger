## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If any issues while installing add legacy-peer-deps:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

If any issues on shadcn components just initialize it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
